A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region.

Currently, the SPI only features indicators for one of the five dimensions of data use, which is data use by international organizations. Indicators on whether statistical systems are providing useful data to their national governments (legislature and executive branches), to civil society, and to academia are absent.  Thus the dashboard does not yet assess if national statistical systems are meeting the data needs of a large swathe of users.","IQ.SPI.PIL2":"The data services pillar overall score is a composite indicator based on four dimensions of data services: (i) the quality of data releases, (ii) the richness and openness of online access, (iii) the effectiveness of advisory and analytical services related to statistics, and (iv) the availability and use of data access services such as secure microdata access. Advisory and analytical services might incorporate elements related to data stewardship services including input to national data strategies, advice on data ethics and calling out misuse of data in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics.","IQ.SPI.PIL3":"The data products overall score is a composite score measureing whether the country is able to produce relevant indicators, primarily related to SDGs.  The data products (internal process) pillar is segmented by four topics and organized into (i) social, (ii) economic, (iii) environmental, and (iv) institutional dimensions using the typology of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This approach anchors the national statistical system\u2019s performance around the essential data required to support the achievement of the 2030 global goals, and enables comparisons across countries so that a global view can be generated while enabling country specific emphasis to reflect the user needs of that country.","IQ.SPI.PIL4":"The data sources overall score is a composity measure of whether countries have data available from the following sources: Censuses and surveys, administrative data, geospatial data, and private sector\/citizen generated data.  The data sources (input) pillar is segmented by four types of sources generated by (i) the statistical office (censuses and surveys), and sources accessed from elsewhere such as (ii)  administrative data, (iii) geospatial data, and (iv) private sector data and citizen generated data. The appropriate balance between these source types will vary depending on a country\u2019s institutional setting and the maturity of its statistical system. High scores should reflect the extent to which the sources being utilized enable the necessary statistical indicators to be generated. For example, a low score on environment statistics (in the data production pillar) may reflect a lack of use of (and low score for) geospatial data (in the data sources pillar). This type of linkage is inherent in the data cycle approach and can help highlight areas for investment required if country needs are to be met.","IQ.SPI.PIL5":"The data infrastructure  pillar  overall score measures the hard and soft infrastructure segments, itemizing essential cross cutting requirements for an effective statistical system.  The segments are: (i) legislation and governance covering the existence of laws and a functioning institutional framework for the statistical system; (ii) standards and methods addressing compliance with recognized frameworks and concepts; (iii) skills including level of skills within the statistical system and among users (statistical literacy); (iv) partnerships reflecting the need for the statistical system to be inclusive and coherent; and (v) finance mobilized both domestically and from donors.","IS.AIR.DPRT":"Registered carrier departures worldwide are domestic takeoffs and takeoffs abroad of air carriers registered in the country.","IS.AIR.GOOD.MT.K1":"Air freight is the volume of freight, express, and diplomatic bags carried on each flight stage (operation of an aircraft from takeoff to its next landing), measured in metric tons times kilometers traveled.","IS.AIR.PSGR":"Air passengers carried include both domestic and international aircraft passengers of air carriers registered in the country.","IS.RRS.GOOD.MT.K6":"Goods transported by railway are the volume of goods transported by railway, measured in metric tons times kilometers traveled.","IS.RRS.PASG.KM":"Passengers carried by railway are the number of passengers transported by rail multiplied by kilometers traveled.","IS.RRS.TOTL.KM":"Rail lines are the length of railway route available for train service, irrespective of the number of parallel tracks.","IS.SHP.GCNW.XQ":"The Liner Shipping Connectivity Index captures how well countries are connected to global shipping networks.
